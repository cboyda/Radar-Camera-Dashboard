# Radar Camera Interactive Excel Dashboard

## Process

1. Downloaded data from multiple [iComs](https://www.icomsdetections.com/) solar powered radar cameras.
2. Challenge: Multiple versions of cameras resulted in inconsistent data for comparisons.  Decided to merge and then created a custom dashboard.

## Purpose

1. Demonstrate a sample of my municipal services being delivered as an interactive dashboard and assist with decisions like the best time of year to setup radar speed traps.
2. Requirements: [Microsoft Excel Dashboard](https://github.com/cboyda/Radar-Camera-Dashboard/blob/17e3e54c3113eb673bcb9924fc52fadf0d4bfbfe/Sundance%20Dashboard.xlsm) needs latest (2023 Office 365 application).  With sample data this download is 30MB+.
3. Application does have MACROs installed that will help automatically revise the details of the graph as you zoom in and out of data parameters.  This is just done to help modify the axis to match the data parameters selected but the application will still run if these are disabled.
4. Yes, I am available [for hire](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clintonboyda/).
